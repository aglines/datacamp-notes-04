setup.txt

get ipynb from dc since it seems to not work there

ok DC cells SEEM to work howver the errors they give are not nec always point to the actual error,
in the ways that doing ti myself here does.  Good lesson!

Ok , kl 12 and still doing data structure review, that seems reasonable 
this is fundamental stuff i need to KNOW it
